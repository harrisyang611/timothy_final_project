This is Timothy Master Indicator Project. It uses ML with Timoty Master's indicators to see whether those indicators help the model.

Data are downloaded from yahoo finance, indicators are created through Timothy executables. Price returns are used for modelling. SKlearn is used for a easy replication for other students. Lime and SHAP are used to determine whether the indicators work.
